            <p>Polyphia is a primarily instrumental progressive rock band based in Plano, Texas, formed in 2010. The group consists of guitarists Tim Henson and Scott LePage, bassist Clay Gober, and drummer Clay Aeschliman.
                
                Polyphia's sound is noted for incorporating virtuosic guitar parts with other styles of music. Initially rooted in a metal-focused tone in their early releases, they developed their music into a more progressive rock sound, combining electronic music and hip hop in their later productions. Polyphia has released four studio albums, two EPs, and numerous singles.
                Polyphia first achieved mainstream success when the guitar play-through of "Impassion", from their EP Inspire, went viral on YouTube. Since then, the band's popularity has grown and they have shared the stage with progressive metalcore artists such as Periphery, Between the Buried and Me, and August Burns Red.

                The band states that their influences come from artists of all genres. The group started out with a heavier shred-oriented sound but has since matured into a more melodic-focused band. When describing the album Muse, guitarist Tim Henson says that the primary inspiration came from pop and rap music.
                
                In a 2013 interview, when asked about the name of the band the following answer was given:
                
                It comes from the word "Polyphony", meaning "music whose texture is defined by the interweaving of several melodic lines". Playing off this definition, as a band, we capitalize on musicianship and that, musically, each member of the band is a cornerstone of our sound. We stray from the idea of a one-dimensional, vocal-centered, or guitar-centered, or drum-centered group, and let each member of the band play an integral part in the overall product. As a people, all of us have a unique and personal identity that makes us dynamic and purposeful, and our band means to convey this quality within all of us through our music; never diminishing the potential of others and thriving in unity.
                
                In September 2022, Polyphia released the single "Ego Death", the fourth from their latest album, Remember That You Will Die. The release was accompanied by a video, both of which feature guitar virtuoso Steve Vai. Remember That You Will Die was released on October 28, 2022, and includes guest appearances by Brasstracks, Snot, Chino Moreno and the aforementioned Vai. The band have announced a 15-date European tour to support it.
                The band was originally known for classical guitar covers on YouTube. Their first EP, Inspire, and first LP, Muse, both show the band's appreciation for pop music. However, both works employ more progressive metal influences than their later releases. This associated them with the djent movement, although they were characteristically less heavy and more melody-based than their peers. Their second studio album, Renaissance, saw the band diverge further away from metal, into a more progressive rock and math rock-influenced sound. They also began to mix elements of EDM, funk, and hip hop, with the single "LIT", a remix of the song "Light", the second track on Renaissance. This sound was further developed with the release of their second EP, The Most Hated, and third LP, New Levels New Devils, which featured production from hip hop and EDM producers Judge and Y2K. The band's fourth studio album, Remember That You Will Die, has continued in this vein, further exploring "trap percussion and hip hop stylings", as well as incorporating a variety of genres, such as bubblegum pop and bossa nova.
